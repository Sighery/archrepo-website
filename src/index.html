<h1>Sighery's Arch Linux repository</h1>
<p>This is an Arch Linux repository holding some packages I either forked and
run, or some packages from the AUR I often use.</p>
<p>This is all
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Sighery?tab=repositories&q=-archbuild">
mostly automated</a>.</p>
<h3>Adding the repository</h3>
<h4>Adding the keys</h4>
<p>Each package is signed with a PGP subkey I use. The database for the
repository itself is also signed with that same PGP subkey. As such, this key
must be imported for Pacman to verify any database update and/or package you
install from this repository has been signed by me.</p>
<pre>
pacman-key --keyserver eu.pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key '9454A24E1B5E963078B6E9317C02D10683ADCFB8'
pacman-key --lsign-key '9454A24E1B5E963078B6E9317C02D10683ADCFB8'
</pre>
<h4>Adding my repository source</h4>
<p>You have to add these lines to your <code>/etc/pacman.conf</code> file:</p>
<pre>
[sighery-archrepo]
Server = https://archrepo.sighery.com/$arch
</pre>
<p>You then run <code>pacman -Syy</code> to update the repo list.</p>
<h4>Current packages</h4>
<p>Currently only <code>x86_64</code> packages are built. All the available
packages can be seen at the
<a href="/x86_64/">x86_64</a> route.</p>
